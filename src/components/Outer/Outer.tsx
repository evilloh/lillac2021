      <p>Thanks for staying with me until the end. I must admit that Control was a... "better" game than Outer wilds. It's like comparing Tiziano's paintings and Carlo's vignette.</p>
      <p>Tiziano's art is perfection. It is the product of the evolution of getting AAA games. It is flawless. But even if Carlo's art might not be perfect, might not be for everybody... it has soul. It tells you a story. And you can dream with it, you can call it... friend.</p>
      <p>Outer wilds was slightly out of my comfort zone, since it's the kind of game that doens't tell you the story staright, you have to explore to know it. But I enjoyed it anyways. So... not my genre, not perfect... why is this the lilac winner?</p>
      <p>Because it occoured on many occasions that I just literally dropped my jaw playing the game. I got stunned beyond understanding. It's so hard for me to find the words to explain what emotions hit me. Amazed? Surprised? Delighted? Fragoloso? I just know that I felt shivers of joy and disbelieve in front of many many places that I visited in the game.</p>
      <p>Did I enjoy Control? Yes. Did Control give me emotions that I thought I couldn't feel anymore from a videogame? Nop. Outer Wilds did.</p>
